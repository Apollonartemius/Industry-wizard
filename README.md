Hospital Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

> Disclaimer : All names, data, and institutions in this project are fictional and created solely for educational and demonstration purposes.

1. Project Overview:

This project showcases an end-to-end hospital analytics dashboard built using **Power BI**. The goal is to simulate how real-time insights can support hospital management in optimizing:

- Bed utilization (ICU, Private, General)
- Diagnosis trends
- Billing vs. insurance coverage
- Doctor performance
- Seasonal demand patterns

The dataset spans Dec 2022 – Mar 2024, containing over 7,000 synthetic patient records.

2. Files Included
   
- 'Dataset.xlsx' – Cleaned hospital data (admission, discharge, ward, diagnosis, billing, etc.)
- `Hospital bed.pbix` – Power BI file with interactive visuals and DAX measures
- `Report-3.pdf` – Written analysis with key findings and methodology

---

 3. Dashboard Features

- Bed Occupancy– Analyze ward-wise patient counts
- Diagnosis Funnel – See which illnesses are most common
- Billing vs. Insurance – Compare test costs and insurance coverage
- Doctor Performance – Evaluate feedback and patient load
- Utilization Score – Identify high- and low-efficiency segments
- Seasonal Trends – Plan around disease surges by month or season
- Custom Filters – Filter data by date range, doctor, diagnosis, and more

4. Key Insights

- Private wards had the highest revenue; **General wards** showed longer stays but lower efficiency.
- Viral infections were the most common diagnosis, especially in winter months.
- CT and MRI tests generated the most billing revenue.
- ICU stays were longer, especially under specific doctors — revealing bottlenecks.
- Opportunities identified for improved discharge planning, test promotion, and seasonal resource allocation.
